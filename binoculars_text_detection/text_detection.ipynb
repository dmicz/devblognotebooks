    "The ability to detect AI-generated text is an important issue, not only because of academic integrity issues, but also due to misinformation, security, and copyright concerns. A new method for detection of machine-generated text, called *Binoculars*, achieves over 90% accuracy in detection at a 0.01% false positive rate. In this notebook, I annotate key parts of the paper, explaining the mechanisms behind this new method and implementing it piece-by-piece. Code from the original paper is available [here](https://github.com/ahans30/Binoculars/tree/main) and this Jupyter Notebook is available [here](https://github.com/dmicz/devblognotebooks).\n",

    "# LLM Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind LLM Detection is harm reduction, to trace text origins, block spam, and identify fake news produced by LLMs. *Preemptive detection* methods attempt to \"watermark\" generated text, but requires full control of the generating models, which already seems to be impossible. Therefore, more recent works have been on *post-hoc detection* methods, which could be used without the cooperation of the text's author. The paper's authors suggest that there are two main groups for post-hoc detectors, the first being finetuning a pretrained language model to perform binary classification. There are many additional techniques that make this approach more effective, but all implementations will require training on text produced by the target model, which is both computationally expensive and limited by the number of new models that are being open-sourced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second group uses statistical signatures of machine-generated text, with the aim of zero-shot learning. This would allow for the detection of a wide range of models, with little to no training data. These methods use measures such as perplexity, perplexity curvature, log rank, intrinsic dimensionality, and n-gram analysis. The Binoculars paper proposes a focus on low false positive rate (FPR) and high performance on out-of-domain samples, rather than focusing on classifier AUCs for the high-stakes application of LLM detection.\n",

    "## Perplexity\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of LLM inference](diagram1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs parse a string of characters $s$ into tokens using a tokenizer $T$, providing a list of tokens $\\vec{x}$. Given this input of tokens, a language model $\\mathcal{M}$ predicts the token that is next in the sequence by outputting a probability distribution over its vocabulary, $V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathcal{M}(T(s))=\\mathcal{M}(\\vec{x})=Y \\\\\n",
    "    Y_{ij} = P(v_j | x_{0:i-1})\\,\\text{for all}\\,j\\in V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural way to then predict whether or not text was generated by a machine is to measure how likely it is that the language model $\\mathcal{M}$ generates each token in $s$, given all the tokens before it. *Perplexity* is a common baseline that measures this, and we define log-perplexity ($\\log \\text{PPL}$) as the average log-likelihood of all tokens in $s$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\log \\text{PPL}_{\\mathcal{M}}(s)=-\\frac{1}{L} \\sum^L_{i=1}\\log(Y_{ix_i}), \\\\\n",
    "    \\text{where}\\,\\vec{x}=T(s), Y=\\mathcal{M}(\\vec{x})\\,\\text{and $L=$ number of tokens in $s$}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is a reasonable first approach for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "- Humans often produce higher perplexity text than LLMs (\"more surprising\").\n",
    "- The loss function LLMs are trained on *is* the log perplexity, as the models are effectively asked to reproduce its test data, given only a prefix of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity, however, is insufficient alone as an approach to detect LLMs. There are many prompts that may produce high perplexity output, such as those that introduce highly specialized domain knowledge, complex vocabulary, new ideas, or prompts that create output that is highly dependent on the context. Tuning the perplexity threshold high enough to catch these LLM outputs inevitably raises the false positive rate for output that is produced by humans, but is more predictable and less domain specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example from the original paper, prompts such as \"1, 2, 3,\" have the lowest perplexity with completions such as \"4, 5, 6.\" However, a prompt about a capybara that is also an astrophysicist produces surprising output, which has a high perplexity. With context, the perplexity of the output would be much lower, but LLM detection in practice must rely on not having access to the language model's context or prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "*Binoculars* uses a mechanism motivated by the aforementioned problems to estimate \"baseline perplexity\" that was induced by the context and prompt of a text. By comparing actual perplexity to the expected perplexity, we have a much better idea of whether or not an LLM produced the text in question. This is because we can expect the perplexity of human-written text to be *even higher* perplexity than that of a machine, given the same prompt and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the baseline perplexity, the authors introduce *cross-perplexity*, which is cross-entropy measured between two models on the same string $s$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\log\\text{X-PPL}_{\\mathcal{M}_1,\\mathcal{M}_2}(s)=-\\frac{1}{L}\\sum^L_{i=1}\\mathcal{M}_1(s)_i\\cdot\\log(\\mathcal{M}_2(s)_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: The measure relies on the models having the same tokenizer $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This score in essence measures how surprised $\\mathcal{M}_1$ is by the token predictions of $\\mathcal{M}_2$, therefore providing some sense of how much perplexity a machine-generated token may have. Combining this with perplexity, we reach the proposed *Binoculars* score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    B_{\\mathcal{M}_1\\mathcal{M}_2}(s)=\\frac{\\log\\text{PPL}_{\\mathcal{M}_1}(s)}{\\log\\text{X-PPL}_{\\mathcal{M}_1,\\mathcal{M}_2}(s)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this mechanism, $\\mathcal{M}_1$ acts as the *observer* model, while $\\mathcal{M}_2$ acts as the *performer* model. The score is then a comparison of how surprising the producer of the string is and how surprising the performer model's predictions of the string are.\n",

Therefore, more recent works have been on *post-hoc detection* methods, which could be used without the cooperation of the text's author. The paper's authors suggest that there are two main groups for post-hoc detectors, the first being finetuning a pretrained language model to perform binary classification. There are many additional techniques that make this approach more effective, but all implementations will require training on text produced by the target model, which is both computationally expensive and limited by the number of new models that are being open-sourced.\n",
    "The second group uses statistical signatures of machine-generated text, with the aim of zero-shot learning. This would allow for the detection of a wide range of models, with little to no training data. These methods use measures such as perplexity, perplexity curvature, log rank, intrinsic dimensionality, and n-gram analysis. The Binoculars paper proposes a focus on low false positive rate (FPR) and high performance on out-of-domain samples, rather than focusing on classifier AUCs for the high-stakes application of LLM detection.''',\n",

    "In order, these are the token-wise perplexity, cross-perplexity, and Binoculars score. The middle output therefore shows how surprised the observer model is by the performer model's predictions. Recalling the Binoculars score definition, the final output shows the perplexity given the baseline perplexity induced by the prompt, which substantially changes the scoring of each token. The words with the highest Binocular scores (red) contribute most to the \"human-generated\" label, and we that the tokens about capybaras are not close to the highest scoring words, while \"fellow\", \"whispered\", and \"directly\" contribute most to the possibility that the text is human-written."

    "human = '''The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients' education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such educational sessions demonstrate that a patient is not unique with such a health issue. As a result, such interventions can improve people's morale, which, in turn, will lead to increased motivation to take preventive measures and protect health.'''\n",
